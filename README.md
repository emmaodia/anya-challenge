# ANYA Coding Challenge

_Coding Challenge: You are given a random number generator that will give you a number between 9 and 20 inclusive. You need a random number between 1 and 100 inclusive instead. How do you convert one to the other? The Ideal answer will be in Javascripts with tests._

The solution is a Random Number Generator in [`index.js`](./index.js). Tests are in [`test/main.js`](./test/main.js)

To run project:

1. Clone the project into a dir, cd in the dir, and run `npm install`
2. In the dir via the terminal, run `node index.js` to run the code and see results, you can change the args passed to `main()`
3. To run tests, use `npm run test`.
